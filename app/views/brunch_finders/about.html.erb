  <p>It can be pretty difficult to make decisions the morning after a late night.  Brunchover does the work for you and only shows you the top 10 places near your search location. We display how many users are checked in on Foursquare so you can avoid the places with the long waiting lists and and enjoy your Brunchover. Need more info a spot?

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>Every Sunday (and several Saturdays) I receive a ping on my cell that one of my closest friends from college, <a href="https://twitter.com/JenMarieMuir" target="_blank">@jenmariemuir</a> has just posted a new photo on Facebook. It is always a photo of her enjoying brunch wherever she is in the country and always with a tasty bloody mary in her hand.</p>

<p>One Sunday in June I was sitting in Epicenter Cafe in SF with B trying to figure out what to do for my Web Dev Immersive Class at <a href="http://generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> due in a week. It was in that moment that I received that ding and BOOM the Brunchover idea was born.</p>

<h3>Who made this?</h3>
<p>Oh hi. I'm Elizabeth. I'm a full stack developer returning from some years on the business side of tech. I'm currently looking for a position at an awesome company. Check me out and contact me at @elizahyde, <a href="http://github.com/elizahyde" target="_blank">github</a>, or <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/ehramberg" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<h3>How results are chosen</h3>
<p>Although I believe user reviews have their place (picking out specific good items...getting a picture of the atmosphere), I believe that data such as return visits and interaction behavior (photo posting, sharing of a site, etc.) are better indicators of "top spots". I did a lot of experiementation with several APIs, even combining them into crazy alogorithms, but in the end the best metrics and the cleanest code came from using Foursquare's venues API with the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/explore" target="_blank">explore endpoint</a>. I choose to do it without user authenticiation (mine or the users) as a) I am not that cool b) that would defeat the purpose of my site's simplicity. Each results page shows a max of 10 results.</p>

<h3>Sorting/Ranking</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span color="#ffc940">10 Result selection:</span> Algorithm based on various popularity over time metrics (total checkins, likes, photos, etc.)</li>
    <li><span color="#ffc940">Initial sort/Most Visited:</span> Total checkins overtime</li>
    <li><span color="#ffc940">Crowd Status:</span> Current checkedin users</li>
    <li><span color="#ffc940">Distance:</span> Distance from search location. If neighborhood or city, this will be from the center of location entered.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Front-end and design</h3>
<p>I pretty much did the who html and css by scratch. I did leverage CSS from <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/" target="_blank">isotope</a>, the AWESOME jQuery plugin I used for my results page. I did a huge amount of custimization and hacking to the CSS but definitely want to shout out for the awesome CSS page and the lovely layout plugin. Also, I pretty much had no clue what I was doing and it was super user friendly. The photos are pulled from the Foursquare venues API again but the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/photos" target="_blank">photos endpoint</a>.</p>

<h3>That autocomplete/geocoder</h3>
<p>That's <a href="http://ubilabs.github.io/geocomplete/" target="_blank">Geocomplete</a> by Ubilabs. I am still working on dealing with some errors that I know it can help fix. I'm a jQuery/geocode newby so bear with me please.</p>
